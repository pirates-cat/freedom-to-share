    description:
      title: Description
      body: To legalise sharing – via digital networks, for personal use and non-profit purposes – of files containing works and other material protected by copyright, related rights and sui generis database rights, with a view to striking a balance between the rights of authors and other rightholders and the universal right to science and culture.

    acronym: FAQ
    title: Frequently Asked Questions
    entries:
      what-are-related-rights:
        title: What are «related rights»?
        body: In copyright law, related rights are the rights of a creative work not connected with the work's actual author. Within the European Union, the rights of film producers (as opposed to directors) and database creators are also protected by related rights. A practical definition is that related rights are copyright-type rights that are not covered by the Berne Convention.
      why-should-i-sign-this-european-citizen-initiative:
        title: Why should I sign this European Citizen Initiative?
        body: To foster sharing, and thus spreading, of creative works, other contents, and culture; to be free to access creative works without having to be controlled and profiled.
      why-its-important-to-avoid-control-and-profiling-by-platforms:
        title: Why it's important to avoid control and profiling by platforms?
        body: Because you have the right to be free. Free to look for and find the works that you want, driven by your own curiosity and not by algorithmic filter bubbles that decide for you, without listing what you download in the supplier's databases.
      how-will-file-sharing-freedom-benefit-citizens:
        title: How will file sharing freedom benefit citizens?
        body: They will be free to access works through file sharing networks without being required to use platforms that profile them.
      i-like-being-social-why-p2p-file-sharing-should-be-better-than-distribution-platforms:
        title: I like being social. Why p2p file sharing should be better than distribution platforms?
        body: |
          Because p2p file sharing allows you to be really social: when you share files, at the same time you get files from other people. Interacting with an algorithm is not being social. P2p sometimes optimizes bandwith usage, when you are collecting a file that is available at many other clients, many of them might send you different parts at the same time, considerably reducing transfer time.
      how-much-will-it-cost-for-users:
        title: How much will it cost for users?
        body: There is a spectrum of possible implementations of our proposal. We believe it's possible, with modern empirical methods and evidence-based economics, to calculate the fair compensation for the various scenarios.
      how-will-freedom-to-share-files-benefit-artists:
        title: How will freedom to share files benefit artists?
        body: |
          They will receive money for the use of their works from file sharers. Moreover they will allow citizens to access their works by means that are not under controll of third parties: authors will enojoy more freedom and their works will be at hand.
      if-file-sharing-is-free-how-will-artists-earn-money:
        title: If file sharing is free how will artists earn money?
        body: They will receive a share of the fair remuneration paid by users for accessing their works. This will add to their usual means of remuneration.
      what-should-authors-do-to-make-sure-that-their-work-is-available-for-file-sharing:
        title: What should authors do to make sure that their work is available for file sharing?
        body: Publish it and wait for citizens to share it. If they want, they can also personally make available their work through file sharing networks.
      what-if-an-author-does-not-agree-to-have-his-work-shared-through-file-sharing-networks:
        title: What if an author does not agree to have his work shared through file sharing networks?
        body: He is free to not publish his work and then his work will not be shared. Once a work is public, all citizens have some right (sing privately, make copies for personal use and, we believe, use file sharing networks for personal use).
      how-should-money-be-distributed-among-authors-and-other-right-holders:
        title: How should money be distributed among authors and other right holders?
        body: Collecting societies already have different methods to share among authors and other right holders the fair remuneration collected (money collected from the private copy levy, etc.). We believe that distribution of fair compensation collected for file sharing could be very fair if done properly. As way of example, it could be possible to develop transparent and fair statistics on the works shared through file sharing networks implementing a safe "counter" measuring the number of transfers for each file and dividing the total amount collected proportionally between content creators.
      are-you-against-authors:
        title: Are you against authors?
        body: Not at all. We want to update copyright so that it's compatible with modern reality and people's preferences. We believe modern technology is an opportunity for authors, not a problem. We also believe that it's harmful for authors to depend on and support very unfair and unpopular status quo of copyright laws. Some authors might be appreciated and know by people much more thanks to file sharing.
      are-you-against-rightsholders:
        title: Are you against rightsholders?
        body: No, as long as they pursue the stated objectives of copyright (and author rights), that is the promotion of culture and social progress. Majors lost an opportunity when they attacked Napster in the early 2000; they could have sided with it and gained a free money machine. Instead they missed a decade and now they depend on royalties from Spotify, Apple, etc. for their survival. Our proposal is an opportunity for collecting societies, publishers, record labels and other rightsholders too.
      are-you-against-digital-platforms:
        title: Are you against digital platforms?
        body: No, if they do not abuse of their power to control and profile people. The various internet services which have come to dominate the digital distribution of culture can be a net positive because they make distribution more efficient. Disintermediation can also reduce the amount of money wasted on middlemen who do not produce any additional culture. However, we don't see why giant centralised internet services run by few multinationals should be in control of culture in the digital era. Efforts like article 17 in directive 790/2019 ("upload filters") were misguided, and will inevitably fail, because they failed to attack the root problem.
      do-you-want-to-destroy-existing-digital-distribution-channels:
        title: Do you want to destroy existing digital distribution channels?
        body: No. Services survive in the long run because consumers like them, not because politicians write this or that law.
      file-sharing-platforms-are-competitors-of-netflix-spotify-and-other-content-distribution-platforms:
        title: File sharing platforms are competitors of Netflix, Spotify and other content distribution platforms?
        body: |
          No. Because they are networks, there is no single competitor: file sharing networks are distributed (there is no mandatory intermediary). File sharing networks are owned by the citizens that participate in it.
      is-it-true-file-sharing-gives-the-opportunity-to-find-stuff-very-rare-no-more-on-the-market-located-in-some-unknown-place-difficult-to-find:
        title: Is it true file sharing gives the opportunity to find stuff very rare / no more on the market /located in some unknown place, difficult to find?
        body: Yes, as long as some part of the network has it. Sometimes, when usual channel fail, some stuff is already there, ready to be collected. On some networks nowaday, there are 10-40 million files available, with million nodes-users.
      this-is-only-a-dream:
        title: This is only a dream!
        body: We realise that our proposal is the only way to go ahead for a copyright based on fundamental rights. We think sometimes such ambition is needed.
      this-is-not-a-new-idea:
        title: This is not a new idea!
        body: Admittedly, it's mostly an old idea. The most famous variant is probably Fisher's proposal of a statutory license to solve problems like Napster being shut down because it was only able to stop 99,4 % of copyright infringement but not 100 %. <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/freeculture.pdf">See "Free culture" (2004), p. 307.</a>
      you-want-to-violate-copyright:
        title: You want to violate copyright!
        body: No. We want to change copyright and our proposal is compatible with the Berne convention and related treaties.
